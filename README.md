# FDA AI/ML-Enabled Medical Devices

Interactive, single-page dashboard for exploring FDA-posted AI/ML-enabled medical device approvals since 2016. The site is designed to support a regulatory-facing narrative on growth, diversification, and new entrants.

Live site: https://vishalsachdev.github.io/fda/

## What this project shows
- Approvals per year, filtered by panel and search.
- Panel mix for the current filter set.
- New entrants per year (first appearance of companies and product codes).
- A filterable device list with passthrough links to FDA submission records.

## Data source
- FDA AI/ML-Enabled Medical Devices list:
  https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-enabled-medical-devices
- The downloaded XML is stored as `ai-ml-enabled-devices-xml.xml`.
- The dashboard embeds the parsed data directly into `index.html` as JSON.

## How to use locally
No build step required.
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Use the year range, panel filter, and search box to update charts and the device list.

## Methodology and assumptions
- Each row reflects a single FDA list entry with a final decision date, panel, and product code.
- Counts reflect FDA list entries as posted; they do not normalize for device families or company reorganizations.
- "New entrants" indicates the first appearance year of a company or product code in this dataset.
- The view focuses on 2016 onward to highlight the period of accelerated growth.

## Repository structure
- `index.html`: Single-file app (HTML, CSS, JS, embedded data).
- `ai-ml-enabled-devices-xml.xml`: Raw source data download from FDA.

## Updating the data
1. Download the latest XML from the FDA source page.
2. Replace `ai-ml-enabled-devices-xml.xml`.
3. Rebuild the embedded JSON in `index.html` (the current file was generated by parsing the XML).
4. Commit and push to redeploy via GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages
The site is published from the `main` branch at `/`:

## Known limitations
- Product code taxonomy and panel categories are used as-is from FDA.
- Company names may appear with variations across entries.
- No external enrichment (device class, clearance type, modality, geography) is included yet.

## Future enhancements
- Add clearance type (510(k), De Novo, PMA) and device class.
- Add modality/task taxonomy for AI use cases.
- Add company headquarters and geography.
